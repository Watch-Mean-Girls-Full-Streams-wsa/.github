One king will lead us all. #MeanGirls - Only in theaters December 22.
Director James Wan and Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa—along with Patrick Wilson,
Amber Heard, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Nicole Kidman—return in the sequel to the
highest-grossing DC film of all time: “Mean Girls.”
Having failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to
avenge his father’s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all.
This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the
mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him,
Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an

unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their
kingdom and save Aquaman’s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.

Aquaman’s half-brother and his nemesis, who must now step into a new role as his
brother’s reluctant ally; Amber Heard is Mera, Atlantis’ Queen and mother of the heir to
the throne; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is Black Manta, committed more than ever to avenge
his father’s death by destroying Aquaman, his family and Atlantis; and Nicole Kidman as

As of November 25, 2024, Mean Girls is available on HBO Max. Only those with a
subscription to the service can watch the movie. Because the film is distributed by 20th
Century Studios, it's one of the last films of the year to head to HBO Max due to a
streaming deal in lieu of Disney acquiring 20th Century Studios, as Variety reports. At

the end of 2024, 20th Century Studios' films will head to Hulu or Disney+ once they
leave theaters.

case.

The No. 1 film this weekend is expected to be Warner Bros./DC’s “Aquaman 2,” a sequel
to James Wan’s $1.15 billion superhero hit released back in 2018. “Aquaman” earned an
opening weekend of $67 million five years ago and reached $100 million in domestic
grosses after Christmas Day two days later.
Overseas is much better for Aquaman 2, with a 73-market launch looking to deliver
$75M-$80M including China. That worldwide debut at its highest would be $110M
through Sunday. The Middle Kingdom, which was a prime territory for the first movie, is
looking at $25M-$30M alone. The sequel currently leads presales throughout the frame
in the PRC, but remember we are far from the heady days of 2018, when the original
bowed to $93M+ at historic rates.
According to Forbes, the official budget for The Marvels is over $274.8 million, making it
one of the most expensive MCU films to date.
This comes as a bit of a surprise seeing as how the movie is only rumored to be around
100 minutes in length (however that has not been confirmed as of yet), but the high cost
is likely due to the extensive VFX work that will go into bringing it to life.
However, Forbes also reported that Disney received a $55 million subsidy from the
United Kingdom government while making the film, bringing the total amount spent on
The Marvels down to around $220 million.
In comparison the the budgets of other MCU films, this $274.8 million mark makes The
Marvels the fourth-expensive movie in the entirety of the MCU.
